# StyleMate-Python
StyleMate is an app that helps you pick outfits with ease. After inputing your entire wardrobe, and receiving daily weather forecasts, StyleMate can recommend you outfits to wear every day of the week.

## Why Python?
To build a proof of concept (POC) for StyleMate, this version was created to demostrate the basic functions used in the real app. 

## Project Stack:
- Language => Python
- GUI => Tkinter
- APIs => Axios/RapidAPI

## Goals/Features:
- Request & Display Weather for entire week in app
- Be able to input clothes as images, text, and keywords
    - Wiil just input images from pc and not photo app as POC
- Use an aesthetic UI that may be simpler than mobile version of app
- Simply reccoomend clothes based on temp. and clothing type
    - If hot, where t-shirt
    - if cold, where hoodie
