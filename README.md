# StyleMate-Python
StyleMate is an app that helps you pick outfits with ease. After inputing your entire wardrobe, and receiving daily weather forecasts, StyleMate can recommend you outfits to wear every day of the week.

## Why Python?
To build a proof of concept (POC) for StyleMate, this version was created to demostrate the basic functions used in the real app. 

## Project Stack:
- Language => Python
- GUI => Tkinter
- APIs => Axios/RapidAPI

## Phase 1 Project Goals: ‚≠ê
- Build Stamina in Python Coding
- Learn how to build good GUIs with Tkinter
- Build App Structure with Blank Pages (Will add "outline" for pages)

## Phase 2 Project Goals:
- Finish All Page Screens with Complete Designs
- Connect Weather API to get real forecasts
- Learn how to use upload buttons with Python
- Connect Wardrobe Management with Firebase

## Phase 3 Project Goals
- Create an outfit planning algorithm to pick outfits based on weather and style
